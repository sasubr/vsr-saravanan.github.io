<h2>What to start?</h2>
<p>
It's really confusing on where to start w.r.t. Panuval. Clearly, whatever we are doing right now is not working. On the one hand, I need to work towards long term goals. In the mean time, need to focus on generating revenue to make the ends meet. It's clear the traditional way of doing business is becoming bull shit. What I'm writing here is w.r.t Panuval (selling tamil books). People are not reading any more. No, people read but not in the scale that it will be a business. And there a lot of players and day by day, it is reaching saturation point. People like to watch. People like to listen. The liking to read is on the diminishing. But I don't have any data. It's just my hunch. 
</p>
<p>
What ever I do should have many ends. If one fails, I can use the same work for other goals, thereby saving time and working smartly. So, I need to design my tasks accordingly. Every work should be a head fake for others. Panuval should be changing according to the times. At the end of 5 years from now, Panuval should be synonymous for everything realted to tamil (be it ebook, audio book, physical book, tamil printed merchandise). How I can achieve this? Every work I do related to Panuval shpuld be a head fake to this final goal and in the mean time sustaning it. 
</p>
<p>
People say there is a lack of distribution channels for tamil books. But I think, our society is going to skip that part and go directly to ebook or v-book . 2g to 4g, skipping 3g. We should not waste energy setting up distribution channels for publishers, though it is the need of the hour. It will vanish soon. So, what can Panuval do? Panuval need to create itself an ecosystem for ebook, audio book, print on demand catering only to tamil books. How can it compete with Amazon with out an e-reader and tech? Gasp. Is it a futile effort to compete?  Whatever I wish to do, Common Folks is arleady doing.
</p>
<p>
We are even missing the basics of business. Keeping books, balance sheet, profit/loss statment. This should be no.1 priority.
</p>
<p> After a lot of confusion for nearly years, I think i'm starting to get a clear picture of what Panuval needs to do. First, sustain the business that we are in right now. Eventhough, it's dying, it can be made sustainable. A lots of players in the field kicking proves that. So, perfect the art and business of physical book selling. Build a loyal set of customers, make profit. Don't venture in to other areas without making profit in the exiting area. We will not have confidence. And investors will not have confidence. So, the things not to focus will be ebooks, audio books, my other interests (youtube channel, music, painting etc). The things to focus will be improving the experience for cusomers, suppliers and staff in the current model of business.
</p>
<p>
Now, comes the important question, how to improve the experience of customers?
1. Amzing customer service. It's a phrase that doesn't make sense while in the field. We need to define what is amazing customer service w.r.t. Panuval. I should define it. 
2. Amazing supplier experience. Proper accounting. 

Competitions:
1. A lot of new players doing better than us. 
     - They have superior collection of books. 
     - They do one thing well.
     - They have superior design.
     - They provide good service.

Our plus points:
1. We have physical store; We have good reputation. We have sincere staff. We don't need to see profit immediately. 
The above points still don't define the action points. 

What do we lack?
- A lack of focus. Cannot exactly pin point. But it has got to do with me (my leadership). I should improve on this. 
- Not reacting to customer needs. In plain sight, customers have been asking for exam books. We have not bat an eye for this. It's not our policy not to have exam books. We at times, talked about procuring exam books. But we havenot. This is a perfect example of this non-reactiveness from our side. This needs to change.
- Also, we are missing ABC (Alwaysb be closing). Close a deal and move forward. Don't let it dangling. This applies to me.  

The lesson here is 
1/ Take small steps. Start with one thing. Do it really well. Follow it up. Make it a routine. Then move to the next small step.
2/ Avoid distractions. How to identify distractions? It's a tuffy. We need to prioritize the things and act accordingly.
3/ 

The step forward?
1/ Proper accounting. Jayaprakash and Saravanan.
2/ Proper Order fulfilement. Ram and Ezhuamalai.
3/ Proper Request Fulfilment. Ram and Ezhumalai.
4/ New books at Panuval. Ram and Saravanan.
5/ GST for Panuval. Saravanan.
</p>

<p>
Falling prey to distractions: It's a diffcult beast to handle. That's why I need to split into smaller tasks making it very easy to handle. Many tasks are so intertwined some times, it looks like a big pile of mess. 
</p>

<p>
What is my big goal? What are my smaller goals to achienve that? and What are my micro goals to achieve smaller goals and what is the atomic action and its prority so that eveything falls beautifully in place. OH NO!.
</p>

<p>
My big goal: Panuval should be synonymous for everything realted to tamil reading (be it ebook, audio book, physical book, tamil printed merchandise).

My smaller goal: Be a leader in selling physical book.
