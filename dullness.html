<h2>Dull</h2>
<p> Right now, I'm experiencing an episode of dullness in my life. The things which once excited me now irritates me. Am I burned out?
I doubt if I ever started burning at the first place to get burned out. Then what is this numbness that makes me want to jump in to abyss and keep falling.
    Everything distracts me -- a phone call, a song, a tap on the shoulder. I wish to be alone. I turned off the phone for 2 days and it got
    everyone pissed off. I know this is not healthy. When everyone is around me, I get cheerful and energetic. But the moment they are gone,
    dullness evades. Am I depressed? Should I seek medical help?
    </p> <p>I sit in the bathroom for hours doing nothing.I'm afraid to turn on the shower. I thought I did that because of the initial rush of stale cold water in the pipe.
    I stay isanely long hours at office, sleeping in the dormitory often. No productive work gets done. I got good at fake work.
    I stare at the monitor with blank mind.
    My desk is a mess. My room is shit. I hate myself. I have no life. My body aches, heart beats faster. But to everyone around me, I seem okay. Only, I know the struggle.
I keep up with this sane act only for my mother. She is the last thread tied to me which keeps me from insanity. I pray the thread to
remain strong.</p>

    <p>I never talked about this to anyone. The answer everyone gives is "It's all in your mind!" "Look at the people below  you". I fooled myself with the same
        answer. But, trust me, that is not the correct answer. Sometimes, I feel I will fail to climb up this spiral and get sucked into the vortex. That way it will be over soon.
    This struggle to climb up the spiral exhausts me and leaves me gasping. I can't just put a label on what is going on
    with me right now -- Depression, Bipolar, Midlife crisis, Stress of managing work and book store. I experienced some thing like this even before
    the book store era. My brother and me used to joke that our family gene is one of the worst possible combinations and should not be
    propagated. Am I genetically predestined to this? My father had many failed attempts to end his life. My father's sister's daughter
    killed herself. By sharing all this, I know I'm making myself vulnerable. But all this hiding is not helping me. I anyone has ever
    felt like this, please reach out to me. We can talk about it.</p>
    <p>
    <em>Broken glasses stuck in my throat! Staring into the abyss now!
    I cannot swallow or spit or jump.
    No one's but my shoulder to cry and console.
    They hear. Pretend and move on.
    I'm breaking and the symptoms already emerge! Somebody help me! </em>
