<h2>Why the name - VSR?</h2>
<p>
It all started with the creation of my email id (vsr.saravanan@gmail.com). The thing about my name, Saravanan, is its like Devi of tamil male nomenclature. If you stand up and yell my name loud in a crowd of 100 people, atleast 5 people will respond. So, natuarally, saravanan@gmail.com was not available, eventhough I was early to the gmail game. I hated adding birth year or any other adjective to my email id which was hip that time (I think still is). I remembered seeing this intial (V.S.R) as an engraving on our stain-less steel utensils to prevent them from getting misplaced or stolen. VSR is acronymn for Vellottamparappu(my home village) Subramaniam(Father) Rathinam(Mother). Adding this as a prefix to my email id seemed natural, hence vsr.saravanan@gmail.com. I felt so much proud that I created another id (vsr.jayendran@gmail.com) for my brother and forced him to use it. Then, I volunteered at an organisation called Vazhai. The probability of 5/100 held well, there were five Saravanans. To distinguish from other Saravanans, nick names were assigned. The brilliant people at Vazhai started calling me VSR and it stuck with me. My times at Vazhai re-defined and changed my perspective of life.
