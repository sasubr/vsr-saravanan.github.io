## Sorrow

For me, everything is unreal except for physical pain and mental pain. Physical pain, though it is unbearable, you can isolate the area of pain and try to cure it or atleast kill the pain. But the worst is mental pain, you can call it depression or sorrow, you can feel the pain but you don't know where. Sleeping is the only time you forget it.
