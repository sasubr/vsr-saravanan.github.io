<h2>Euphoria</h2>
<p>I'm in a very good mood today. I want to freeze this feeling in memory and come to it over and over again.
    I'm surprisingly cheerful and I don't know why. I feel I can accomplish anything.
    I feel I'm on top of the world. I still have the same issues that were there 3 days back.
    But I feel light. Floating. If some chemical composition in my body is responsible for this feeling, I want that chemical to be given
    to me intravenously every waking day of my life.I don't wish to spoil this by introspecting myself. Okay.
    In this stage. I usually graze stuff on internet. Come across some depressing stuff and get depressed. But not today.
    Let's contain this euphoria within myself and create a happiness fusion that will sustain forever.
    Can Saravanan do it? If the fusion goes uncontrollable, he will burst with happiness. For now.
    Let's contain. Let's focus!</p>
