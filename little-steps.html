<h2>Take Small Steps</h2>
<p>
எப்போதுமே பகலாய் போனால் வெப்பம் தாங்காதே 
</p>
<p>
There should be celebrations in life.  Design your system such that there are goals that give positiveness to your life. Yesterday I thought up a whole bunch of things for self discipline. I am not able to follow anything. I felt disappointed and the sunken place is getting deeper. Sometimes I feel there is no way out. There is no straight ladder that will take me out of this place. The only way is to the go up the way I came down, spiral. Spiral your way up through little milestones of succeess. It may take long time but it will make sure that I will not spiral down again. Let's take one thing and make it a success.

<p>
Let's take meditation. It will impact all areas of your life. So, let's commit to doing meditation 1 time a day. 1 hour a day. 1 hour of Vipassana and nothing more is expected of you. Make a table and mark your discipline there.
