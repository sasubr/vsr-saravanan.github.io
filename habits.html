<p>I realised Habits are the key to achieve the desired things in life. </p>

<p>I have reached a point in my life where I need extreme discipline to keep things from falling apart. Those missed appointments,
missed phone calls, missed deadlines, un kept promises are coming back to haunt me. I keep postponing until my anxiety reaches a new height and then
I start to work. Had I been more disciplined and not given into distractions, my life would be more different now.</p>

<p>I know I have the potential for great things, but some how I keep repeating same mistakes over and over again. I just grazed facebook and this great quote was waiting for me. Obstacles are what you see when you take the
eye off your goals. So true!</p>

<p>I think I'm a chronic procrastinator. I do things at the edge of time. I plan but never execute. But all these things should end now. If I
continue one day like this, all things I built now will crash and burn.</p>

<p>I need to be aggressive about forming habits. Work should happen while I'm at work. No grazing stuff off the internet. Sometimes, I feel
internet should be banned at the office. Even though I know what needs to be fixed, I simply cannot get myself to do those things. I know I'm distracted at work by facebook, youtube, hacker news. But I simply cannot get myself not to open firefox and type those dreaded urls.
</p>

<p>I learned from a blog post that you can form Tiny Habits as a precursor for big habits. For eg: If I want to drink water at office. You should tell
yourself, once I reach my desk, I will take the water bottle and go to cafeteria. I need to come up with a TinyHabit routine to keep myself
away from distraction. Pomodoro Technique has helped me a lot in the initial days when I was learning the technique. I need to start using that
technique again. Here's the tiny habit I will follow to start using the technique. I have an application called FocusBooster for pomodoro technique.
As soon as I unlock my desktop, I will start Focus Booster app.
</p>
<p>So, here are the TinyHabits for the week.</p>
<ul>
    <li>As soon I reach office, I will refill water</li>
    <li>As soon as I unlock desktop, I will start FocusBooster app</li>
</ul>
