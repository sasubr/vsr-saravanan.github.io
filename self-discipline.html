<h2>Self Discipline</h2>
<p>
When the four corners of this cocoon collide<br>
You’ll slip through the cracks hoping that you’ll survive<br>
Gather your wind, take a deep look inside<br>
Are you really who they idolize?<br>
</p>
<p>
I'm stuck. I in the SUNKEN PLACE hypnotised by the past. I can think. But I can't do. There is a gap between what I should be doing and what I am doing. I can't seem to do anything. All I need is self discipline. How to bring self discipline in my life and accomplish things I wish to do?
</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Plan your day ahead the night before. <i><b>PROACTIVE</b></i></li>
        <li> If any new thing arises, promplty make a note of it and that's it. Resist the temptation. Acknowledge the temptation and move ahead.</li>
        <li> Make mental models about the things I'm going to do. Eg: If you are meeting someone, rehearse what you will be saying and the worst things that can happen so that nothing surprises and you are ready for everything.<br>
    <li> Make routines and follow them. What to do when you wake up/reach office/reach home/before sleep etc. </li>
    <li> Meditate daily. <i><b>COMPULSORY</b></i></li>
    <li> If you break the self discipline, again acknowledge, forgive yourself and start where you left off.</li>
    <li> Time is my only wealth. Don't waste it. Spend it wisely. Be aware of the shortness of life. Don't waste it. </li>
    <li> I have 100 things in my mind that I wish to do. It keeps coming back. But right now, just acknowledge the desire. Focus on things that you are supposed/expected to focus. Do things that are expected of you. There is time for other thigs</li>
    <li> Journal often. Write down your baggage. </li>
    </ul>
