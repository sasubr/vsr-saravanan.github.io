<h2>It's not getting any better</h2>
<p>It's not getting any better. I didn't write past few days experience. It's been much worse despite the conscious efforts
I'm taking. I never slept at my room. I've been crashing at office dorm room. My mind is very much blank and am not
able to process any thing. I've never been this numb and tired in my entire life.</p>

<p>One partcular morning, I got up at office dorm and had hard time making up my mind whether to go to my room, freshen up and come back
 or staye here and freshen up. I ended up just sitting at the bus stop for nearly an hour and then boarded a bus to my room. That travel
was refreshing. Travelling really cheers me up.</p>

<p>I visited my native place with my brother. My mother seemed to be in good mood and I didn't want to spoil that. I attended couple of functions.
I get cheerful and talkative there. But the moment I get home, its back. I even went to the length of doing some rituals at temple
to get rid of this. I even threw my old clothes in Kaveri and changed to new one. I'm willing to do anything that cures of me this
dreadful condition.</p>

<p>One song is in loop for 3 days. I don't know when this madness will end. The pain is unbearable. Getting out helps a lot.
But it is not curing. I get back to my room/office and then the dullness invades. I'm at my physical worst ever. A marriage
at this time will spoil both of us. I'm giving whatever reason I can to postpone it or better avoid it.</p>

<p>I reached office at 5.30 am straight from Central station, crashed at office dorm room. I got up at 9 am. Didn't take shower or brush.
I had breakfast.I started to work at 10.30 am. 7 hours have passed. No work got done. I typed few lines of Javascript and that's it.
I simply cannot put myself to work. I can't continue like this forever.</p>

<p>It seems it will be a long night today also with no productive work. I cannot make myself to get out of office also. Because another
depressing environment waits there at my home.</p>

<p>I gathered myself together and came up with things that makes me dull.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Committing something to someone and not doing it.</li>
    <li>Poor investment of my hard earned money.</li>
    <li>Talking to any one to make them do something for me.</li>
    <li> Missed phone calls and fear of calling them back.</li>
</ul>

<p>These fear seem irrational. But it's the reason for my devastation. For others, my problem may seem simple and
that's why I'm not sharing it with anyone. But I'm more confident than ever to get rid of this monster for ever. I will come
up with step by step approach to move up the spiral and eventually out of it.</p>
