<h2>Back to writing!</h2>
<p>
    I have started to update the website again after a looong break (5 years). Nothing has changed about me (which makes me sad) except I got married and got fat, but I still have the same aspirations and dreams. I also got some tools under my belt along the way.  I wish to better myself everyday. I don't know who will be the readers of my writings. I wish to use this website to test my html/css/js skills for now. This website is currently hosted as <a href="https://github.com/vsr-saravanan/vsr-saravanan.github.io"> a github repo </a> coupled with Netlify. It as static as it gets. In the coming days, I will make this website dynamic, with its own CRM and all and make that as a SAAS platform. There will be mobile apps, SSR, PWAs (all the jargons). I will post my learnings, my random thoughts here. Also, i'm embarking on a 100 days of writing challenge for myself. I will share some of those writings here.
