<h1>Let's stop bitching!</h1>
<p>I've been lately bitching about lot of things in my life. My poor work life balance, my dullness, my inability to hold a promise,
    my hectic work, my poor health, my failed hopes and dreams, my fear of speaking in phone blah blah. I'm fed up with this behavior.
    It's pathetic and dangerous both physically and mentally.
    Hence, from now on. I will stop being a bitch and produce results. No one cares about my problem other than my mother.
    So, why should I give a fuck about what others think. I will be straight with every one and communicate what I think and feel
non violently. My sissy days are over. Let's not be a cat on the wall and try to be nice to everyone. The effort is exhausting.</p>

<p> I waste time like it is an infinite resource. I plan, plan and plan but never do. One day, I will wake up and hate myself for sure.
    The following quotes from Seneca woke me up.</p>
    <blockquote>It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune’s control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.
    </blockquote>
    <p>Oliver Sacks was recently diagnosed with terminal cancer at 81. He announced his illness in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/19/opinion/oliver-sacks-on-learning-he-has-terminal-cancer.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&region=CColumn&module=MostEmailed&version=Full&src=me&WT.nav=MostEmailed&_r=0">
        NY Times </a> and a line from his article inspired me.
<blockquote>I feel a sudden clear focus and perspective. There is no time for anything inessential. I must focus on myself, my work and my friends.</blockquote>
    I should never waste time on anything inessential. I will focus on my health, my work and my bookstore.
