<h2>Flow of Ideas</h2>
<p>
For the past 2 days, I'm getting avalanche of ideas. Ideas with some much clarity that it will be executable asap. I'm filled with a drugged state of Euphoria. I know it will not last longer. But I question why nature ought to do these things only to see me fail. Let's wait and watch. This time, conquer the idea, grab it and put to execution. Break into small executable tasks. For this big idea, I need to collaborate with my brother. The main thing is we will do it. Not how ling we take to do it. It may take years or we may never do it. But the thought of executing on it gives me sunken heart in a pleasant way.
</p>
<p>
I'm stuck. I in the SUNKEN PLACE hypnotised by the past. I can think. But I can't do. There is a gap between what I should be doing and what I am doing. I can't seem to do anything. All I need is self discipline. How to bring self discipline in my life and accomplish things I wish to do?
</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Plan your day ahead the night before. <i><b>PROACTIVE</b></i></li>
        <li> If any new thing arises, promplty make a note of it and that's it. Resist the temptation. Acknowledge the temptation and move ahead.</li>
        <li> Make mental models about the things I'm going to do. Eg: If you are meeting someone, rehearse what you will be saying and the worst things that can happen so that nothing surprises and you are ready for everything.<br>
    <li> Make routines and follow them. What to do when you wake up/reach office/reach home/before sleep etc. </li>
    <li> Meditate daily. <i><b>COMPULSORY</b></i></li>
    <li> If you break the self discipline, again acknowledge, forgive yourself and start where you left off.</li>
    <li> Time is my only wealth. Don't waste it. Spend it wisely. Be aware of the shortness of life. Don't waste it. </li>
    <li> I have 100 things in my mind that I wish to do. It keeps coming back. But right now, just acknowledge the desire. Focus on things that you are supposed/expected to focus. Do things that are expected of you. There is time for other thigs</li>
    <li> Journal often. Write down your baggage. </li>
    </ul>
